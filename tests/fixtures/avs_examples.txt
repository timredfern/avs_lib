# AVS-specific expression examples from real effects
# These are expressions commonly found in AVS presets

# Distance from center
d = sqrt(x*x + y*y)

# Polar coordinates  
r = sqrt(x*x + y*y); a = atan2(y, x)

# Color manipulation
r = r * 0.5
g = g * sin(d * 0.1)  
b = b * cos(a)

# Audio-based effects
x = x + sin(d * 0.01) * getspec(0.1, 0.1, 0)
y = y + cos(d * 0.01) * getspec(0.1, 0.1, 0)

# Time-based animation  
t = t + 0.01; x = x + sin(t) * 0.1

# Beat-reactive effects
if(above(bass, 0.5), r = 1, r = r * 0.9)
